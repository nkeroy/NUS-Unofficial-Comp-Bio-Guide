# A Unofficial Guide to the Computational Biology Major at NUS (National University of Singapore)

Comp Bio in NUS is a degree that doesn't have a lot readily available resources on. Lots of information essential to the degree ends up having to be learnt as you go. I'd like to change that. This degree means a lot to me, and so I'd like to create this to give people curious about the degree, or are in the programme to have a good idea of what it entails.

## Where to go when things get tough
I cannot emphasise enough how not-easy this major is. Things will get tough. That's okay, that's the nature of a multidisciplinary degree. That's also incredibly normal and happens to the best of us. That's why time management and having prioritiesis incredibly vital. This degree is not for the feint-hearted, I'll tell you that. 

Do not give up though, for the best of us go through this.

With that in mind, I would highly highly encourage you to make sure you are mentally healthy before coming into this degree. This is a must. If you aren't, please do not see your mental health as a problem; I'd highly recommend getting help before you begin.

If the degree and life gets too tough, I highly encourage you to go see the consellors. If the psychiatrist is your end-goal, this is a way to get a appointment with the in-house UHC psychiatrists. Who I cannot emphasise enough, are all very experienced with dealing with students undergoing high academic stress.

Friends are also important - comrades in battle make things easier. They are your first line of defense. Please make great friends during orientation camp, or run a Discord group for Comp Bio (I'll be happy to help with this). Friends and seniors are your go-to source on academic requirements and how best to cope with your degree - they know this degree better than your professors (and they admit it)

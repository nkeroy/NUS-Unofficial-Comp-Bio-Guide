# A Unofficial Guide to the Computational Biology Major at NUS (National University of Singapore)

Comp Bio in NUS is a degree that doesn't have a lot readily available resources on. Lots of information essential to the degree ends up having to be learnt as you go. I'd like to change that. This degree means a lot to me, and so I'd like to create this to give people curious about the degree, or are in the programme to have a good idea of what it entails.

## General Information 

### What is Comp Bio all about?
Computational Biology is all about 


### What are the minimum requirements for admission? (or: Who should take Comp Bio?)
If you read nothing else in this section: **PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS DEGREE IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BRIDGING MODULE IN SOMETHING YOU'RE LACKING. THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA UNLESS YOU'RE CONFIDENT YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD DECISION ABOUT RAISING YOUR WORKLOAD.**

I just did you a favour. 

As is, exceptional circumstances exist. I'd highly encourage running your own research to assess if you are said class of people. (I was)

Alright, that aside. 

The good news is that Comp Bio will let anyone with an acceptance to NUS Faculty of Science in. You will be assessed for your ability to handle a degree that is not easy above anything else - therefore. If you are given an interview - please convince the professor that you are able to handle the programme. This is a good time for you to run some self assessments of whether or not you are ready for this. It's alright if you're not. There're many ways into Comp Bio/Big Data - this is just one of them. And a very hard core one at that.

In Comp Bio, most (if not all) of your modules are preallocated to you. It is up to you to decide which modules to take every semester when the office asks for preallocaiton options.

I personally disagree with the way your modules are set up in the study plan. I'd highly

## Where to go when things get tough
I cannot emphasise enough how not-easy this major is. Things will get tough. That's okay, that's the nature of a multidisciplinary degree. That's also incredibly normal and happens to the best of us. That's why time management and having prioritiesis incredibly vital. This degree is not for the feint-hearted, I'll tell you that. 

Do not give up though, for the best of us go through this.

With that in mind, I would highly highly encourage you to make sure you are mentally healthy before coming into this degree. This is a must. If you aren't, please do not see your mental health as a problem; I'd highly recommend getting help before you begin.

If the degree and life gets too tough, I highly encourage you to go see the consellors. If the psychiatrist is your end-goal, this is a way to get a appointment with the in-house UHC psychiatrists. Who I cannot emphasise enough, are all very experienced with dealing with students undergoing high academic stress.

Friends are also important - comrades in battle make things easier. They are your first line of defense. Please make great friends during orientation camp, or run a Discord group for Comp Bio (I'll be happy to help with this). Friends and seniors are your go-to source on academic requirements and how best to cope with your degree - they know this degree better than your professors (and they admit it)

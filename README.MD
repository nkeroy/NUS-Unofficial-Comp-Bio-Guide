# A Unofficial Guide to the Computational Biology Major at NUS (National University of Singapore)

Comp Bio in NUS is a degree that doesn't have a lot readily available resources on. Lots of information essential to the degree ends up having to be learnt as you go. I'd like to change that. This degree means a lot to me, and so I'd like to create this to give people curious about the degree, or are in the programme to have a good idea of what it entails.
